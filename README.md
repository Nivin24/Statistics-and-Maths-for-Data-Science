## 📚 Topics Covered

### 1. Descriptive Statistics

#### Core Concepts:
- **Central Tendency** (`central_tendency.md`)
  - Mean (arithmetic mean, properties, use cases)
  - Median (calculation, robustness to outliers)
  - Mode (frequency-based measure)

- **Dispersion** (`dispersion.md`)
  - Range (basic spread measure)
  - Variance (squared deviations)
  - Standard Deviation (interpretable spread)
  - Interquartile Range (IQR, outlier detection)
  - Coefficient of Variation (relative variability)

- **Distribution Shape** (`distribution_shape.md`)
  - Skewness (asymmetry measurement)
  - Kurtosis (tailedness and peakedness)

- **Percentiles & Quartiles** (`percentiles_quartiles.md`)
  - Quartiles (Q1, Q2, Q3)
  - Percentiles (P25, P50, P75, P90, P95, P99)
  - Five-number summary

- **Visualization** (`visualization.md`)
  - Histograms (frequency distributions)
  - Box Plots (five-number summary visualization)
  - Bar Charts (categorical data)
  - Scatter Plots (bivariate relationships)
  - Line Plots (time series trends)

- **Covariance & Correlation** (`covariance_correlation.md`)
  - Covariance (joint variability)
  - Pearson's Correlation (linear relationships)
  - Spearman's Correlation (rank-based correlation)

- **Practical Applications** (`practical_applications.md`)
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Feature Engineering
  - Model Evaluation
  - Business Analytics

- **Best Practices** (`pitfalls_best_practices.md`)
  - Common pitfalls to avoid
  - Best practices for analysis
  - Data documentation standards

### 2. Inferential Statistics

- Confidence Intervals
- Statistical Significance
- P-values and Test Statistics
- ANOVA and Chi-Square Tests

### 3. Probability
- Basic Probability Theory
- Conditional Probability
- Bayes' Theorem
- Probability Distributions
- Random Variables

### 4. Linear Algebra
- Vectors and Matrices
- Matrix Operations
- Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
- Linear Transformations
- Applications in ML

### 5. Calculus
- Derivatives and Differentiation
- Partial Derivatives
- Gradients
- Optimization Techniques
- Applications in Deep Learning
